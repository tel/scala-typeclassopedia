(*Ed.* This is pretty heavily edited to be more appropriate for the Scala hacker.)

Commonly, Scala libraries feature standardized patterns and structures
developed in the Functional Programming community. These take the form of "type
classes" with algebraic or category-theoretic underpinnings. The core
vocabulary of these was developed in the Haskell language community starting in
the early 90s and has spread to many other FP languages which each push the
concepts in new ways.

As you encounter more and more "functional" Scala you're liable to run into
these patterns and so being fluent with them is tremendously helpful for
increasing your FP-in-Scala fluency. Unfortunately, acquiring this fluency
often requires combing through mountains of tutorials, blog posts, mailing list
archives, and IRC logs.

The goal of this document is to serve as a starting point for the student of
Scala wishing to gain a firm grasp of standard functional type classes. The
essentials of each type class are introduced, with examples, commentary, and
extensive references for further reading.
